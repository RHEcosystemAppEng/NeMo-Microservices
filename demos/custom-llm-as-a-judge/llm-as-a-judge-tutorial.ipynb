    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll evaluate medical consultation summaries using:\n",
    "- **Target Model**: A model that generates summaries (default: your deployed NIM, no API key needed)\n",
    "- **Judge Model**: A model that evaluates the summaries (default: your deployed NIM, no API key needed)\n",
    "  - Evaluates on two metrics:\n",
    "    - **Completeness**: How well the summary captures all critical information (1-5 scale)\n",
    "    - **Correctness**: How accurate the summary is without false information (1-5 scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "**No API keys required!** The notebook is pre-configured to use your deployed NIM endpoint for both models.\n"
