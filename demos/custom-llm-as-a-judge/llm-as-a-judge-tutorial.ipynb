        "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage Custom LLM-as-a-Judge through NeMo Evaluator Microservice.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**IMPORTANT**: This notebook uses `env.donotcommit` file for sensitive configuration (tokens, API keys). \n",
        "\n",
        "**Before running this notebook:**\n",
        "1. Copy the template: `cp env.donotcommit.example env.donotcommit`\n",
        "2. Edit `env.donotcommit` and add your `NIM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`\n",
        "3. The `env.donotcommit` file is git-ignored and will NOT be committed to version control\n",
        "\n",
        "**Get your service account token:**\n",
        "```bash\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we'll evaluate medical consultation summaries using:\n",
        "- **Target Model**: NIM Model Serving (meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct) - generates summaries\n",
        "- **Judge Model**: NIM Model Serving (meta/llama-3.2-1b-instruct) - evaluates the summaries\n",
        "  - Evaluates on two metrics:\n",
        "    - **Completeness**: How well the summary captures all critical information (1-5 scale)\n",
        "    - **Correctness**: How accurate the summary is without false information (1-5 scale)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Configuration**: The notebook is pre-configured to use NIM Model Serving (your configured InferenceService) for both models. All configuration is loaded from the `env.donotcommit` file (see Security Setup above).\n",
        "\n",
        "**⚠️ WORKAROUND**: This notebook uses NIM Model Serving (Knative/KServe) with an **external URL** to work around a known Evaluator bug. Evaluator v25.06/v25.08 strips `/chat/completions` from cluster-internal Knative service URLs, but using an external URL (HTTPS) may bypass this issue. Configure your external URL in `env.donotcommit` via `NIM_MODEL_SERVING_URL_EXTERNAL`.\n"

        "**Solutions:**\n",
        "1. **Use Standard NIM Service** instead - standard NIM services (not Knative) work correctly with Evaluator\n",
        "2. **Wait for Evaluator fix** - this needs to be fixed in the Evaluator codebase (bug persists in v25.08)\n",
        "3. **Use external API endpoints** - if your NIM service is accessible via external URL, that might work\n",
