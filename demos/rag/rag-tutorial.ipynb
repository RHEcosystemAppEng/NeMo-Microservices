    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example implements a complete RAG workflow:\n",
    "1. **Document Ingestion**: Upload documents to NeMo Data Store\n",
    "2. **Embedding Generation**: Create embeddings using NeMo Embedding NIM\n",
    "3. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in NeMo Entity Store\n",
    "4. **Query Processing**: Retrieve relevant documents based on user queries\n",
    "5. **Response Generation**: Generate answers using NeMo Chat NIM with retrieved context\n",
    "6. **Optional Guardrails**: Apply safety guardrails to responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**No API keys required!** The notebook uses your deployed NIM endpoints for both chat and embedding models.\n"
